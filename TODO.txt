(no particular order):
• Fix the shader mess, maybe make the object return percentage shadowed? The shader shouldn't need to know RT/RM ideally
• Add ambient occlusion
• Add Material to contain color and what not instead of each object having all that data
• Fix the CPU waste with the current draw system
• Change implementation of perlin noise
• Change the RT/RM so objects only need one function to check if they intersect a ray
• Add camera lookat or similar
• Make the RecursiveTetrahedron work or delete it
• Fix reflections for raymarching
• Add GPU rendering
• Add live movement (or some sort of scene changer)
• Add scene save / load
• Add vector of objects for Scene::addObject
• Add object serialization
• Add transparency
• Add warning for above 1 color
• Add rasterized graphics too
• Switch from openFrameworks to something more direct
