Needed for final project:
• Finish TransformedObject
• Add at least one fractal

For fun (no particular order):
• Fix the shader mess, maybe make the object return percentage shadowed? The shader shouldn't need to know RT/RM ideally
• Add ambient occlusion
• Add Material to contain color and what not instead of each object having all that data
• Add some sort of input file
• Fix the CPU waste with the current draw system
• Change implementation of perlin noise
• Change the RT/RM so objects only need one function to check if they intersect a ray
